# Analysis of a Wind Turbine

**Author: Chung Anthony, Gouders Louis, Lambotte Augustin, Laridon Amaury**

Project done for the part B of the *LENVI2007-Renewable Energy Sources* courses. We have to : 

- Based on the 15-Megawatt Offshore Reference Wind Turbine and from wind data we have to derive the annual energy production and the load factor. 
- Understand the algorithm of the BEM and explain it in the form of a pseudo-code. 
- Apply the BEM algorithm to estimate the torsque and power of the 15MW turbine at selected wind speeds and look at the induction factors obtained. 
	- Compare the calculated values with the actual torque/power curves and comment on the hypotheses, simplifications, etc.
